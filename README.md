# Reducing-GHG-Emissions-from-Buildings-Case-Study

Engineering Design Project at the University of Toronto

Worked in a team of five to design an alternative HVAC system for buildings that could reduce GHG emissions. Our solution consisted of using a Ground Source Heat Pump regulated by a thermostat system. To prove that the design was viable to be used in Toronto, I designed a simulation of a borehole modelled in Autodesk Fusion and tested the heat transfer under the heating and cooling condition in Autodesk CFD. Throughout the course, we individually maintained a design notebook and used a Gantt chart to track our progress.  

Please refer to the "Final Presentation" for an overview of the project.
